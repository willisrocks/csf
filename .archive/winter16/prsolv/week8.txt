By publicly accusing their high school principal of being a pedophile and a drug dealer, Jane has defamed their principal. Since pedophilia and dealing drugs are illegal and are clearly factual charges, not opinions, Jane is most likely guilty of libel. Furthermore, these charges can severely diminish the principal's reputation causing further harm. If Jane had simply shared their opinion, not publicly accused the principal of serious crimes, Jane wouldn’t have crossed a legal threshold.

Jane’s actions were not only illegal, they were also morally wrong as well. By intentionally lying about their principal in a public fashion, Jane’s actions could cause serious harm. Even if the principal was cleared of these charges in the public, allegations of child abuse among educators alone--even ones that are demonstrated to be false--can have lasting damage.

The principal and the school board could have a strong legal case against Jane; however, they should not exercise their legal options unless absolutely necessary. As a minor, Jane can’t be expected to understand the consequences of their actions in the same way that mature adult would be. By bringing a lawsuit against Jane, the principal and the school district would be acting in opposition to their moral responsibility to educate and prepare students for their future life. A lawsuit against an obviously immature and shortsighted teenager would be excessive and could seriously hamper Jane’s ability to further their education. A more appropriate action against Jane would be to educate Jane to the effects of their actions and have Jane make a public retraction and apology.
