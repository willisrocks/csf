2. What sequence of operations would be used to calculate (7 + 1) · (8 − 3) on a normal (infix notation) calculator? How about on a RPN (postfix) calculator?

7 + 1, 8 - 3, 8 * 5
7 1 + 8 3 - *

6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of typed arithmetic calculations?

Advantages:
* You catch type mismatches during compile time instead of run time
* Greater security against excuting malicious code

Disadvantages:
* It's tedious to code

8. Which of the following are illegal and why?
  • bipush 7 - legal
  • bipush -7 - legal
  • sipush 7 - legal
  • ldc -7 - legal
  • ldc2 -7 - illegal, -7 isn't a 2-word constant
  • bipush 200 - illegal, 200 doesn't fit into a single byte
  • ldc 3.5 - legal
  • sipush -300 - legal
  • sipush -300.0 illegal, -300.0 is a floating point number, not an integer
  • ldc 42.15, legal

12. In the ?div instruction, is the number divided by stored at the top of the stack or is it the second element?

The second element. Example, bipush 4, bipush 2, idiv produces 2

13. The surface area of a sphere is four times the area of a circle of equivalent radius. Write a postfix expression to calculate the surface area of a hemispherical dome of radius R.

4.0 3.12 R R * * *

14. Write a postfix expression for the arithmetic mean of the five numbers a, b, c, d, and e.

a b c d e + + + + 5 /
