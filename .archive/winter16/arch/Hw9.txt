Stallings Review Questions
===========================


1. List and briefly define the four main elements of a computer.

Processor, main memory, I/O modules, and system bus

2. Define the two main categories of processor registers.

User-visible and control/status registers.

3. In general terms, what are the four distinct actions that a machine instruction can specify?

Processor-memory, processor-I/O, data processing, control

4. What is an interrupt?

An interrupt is a signal that tells the processor that an I/O device has finished processing an instruction

5. How are multiple interrupts dealt with?

Multiple interrupts are either dealt with in sequential order or with a priority system

6. What characteristics distinguish the various elements of a memory hierarchy?

Memory is contrained by size, speed, and cost. A memory hierarchy provides levels from high speed/high cost/low size to low speed/low cost/high size. As you go down the hierarchy you get: decreasing cost, increading capicity, decreasing speed, and decreasing frequency of use by the CPU.

7. What is cache memory?

A buffer to temporarily hold data that is to be read in and out of a disk

8. List and briefly define three techniques for I/O operations.

Programmed I/O, interrupt-driven I/O, direct memory access

9. What is the distinction between spatial locality and termporal locality?

Spatial locality is when accessed data is clustered together in storage. Temporal locality is when access to an object is clustered in time.

10. In general, what are the strategies for exploiting spatial locality and temporal locality?

By using a cache you can take data that previously only had temporal locality and adding spatial locality by clustering it in the cache
