2. Determine whether f is a function from Z to R if
a) f(n)=±n.

No. More than one image +n and -n.

b) f(n)=√n^2 +1.

Yes. Because you square n (and add one), you will always be taking the square root of a positive number.

c) f(n)=1/(n^2−4).

No. No image for n=2 or n=-2.

4. Find the domain and range of these functions. Note that in each case, to find the domain, determine the set of elements assigned values by the function.

a) the function that assigns to each nonnegative integer its last digit

Domain: {0,1,2,3,...}
Range: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

b) the function that assigns the next largest integer to a positive integer

Domain: {1,2,3,...}
Range: {2,3,4,5...}

c) the function that assigns to a bit string the number of one bits in the string

Domain: U{0,1} * d, where d is the length of the bit string
Range: {0,1,2,3...}

d) the function that assigns to a bit string the number of bits in the string

Domain: U{0,1} * d, where d is the length of the bit string
Range: {1,2,3...}

6. Find the domain and range of these functions.

a) the function that assigns to each pair of positive integers the first integer of the pair

Domain: {1,2,3...}
Range: {1,2,3...}

b) the function that assigns to each positive integer its largest decimal digit

Domain: {1,2,3...}
Range: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

c) the function that assigns to a bit string the number of ones minus the number of zeros in the string

Domain: U{0,1} * d, where d is the length of the bit string
Range: {z,...}

d) the function that assigns to each positive integer the largest integer not exceeding the square root of the integer

Domain: {1,2,3...}
Range: {z,...}

e) the function that assigns to a bit string the longest string of ones in the string

Domain: U{0,1} * d, where d is the length of the bit string
Range: {0,1,2,...}

8. Find these values
a) ⌊1.1⌋ - 1
b) ⌈1.1⌉ - 2
c) ⌊−0.1⌋ - -1
d) ⌈−0.1⌉ - 0
e) ⌈2.99⌉ - 3
f ) ⌈−2.99⌉ -2
g)⌊1/2 + ⌈1/2⌉⌉ - 1
h) ⌈⌊1/2⌋+⌈1/2⌉+ 1/2⌉ - 2

12. Determine whether each of these functions from Z to Z is one-to-one.

a) f(n)=n − 1 - Yes
b) f(n)=n^2 + 1 - No, (-n)^2 == n^2
c) f(n) = n^3 - Yes
d) f(n) = ⌈n/2⌉ - No

33. Suppose that g is a function from A to B and f is a function from B to C .

a) Show that if both f and g are one-to-one functions, then f ◦ g is also one-to-one.

f(g(x)) = f(g(y))
x = y

40. Let f be a function from the set A to the set B. Let S and T be subsets of A. Show that

b) f(S∩T)⊆f(S)∩f(T).

4. What are the terms a0, a1, a2, and a3 of the sequence {an},
where an equals
(-2)^0 = 1
(-2)^1 = -2
(-2)^2 = 4
(-2)^3 = -8

10. Find the first six terms of the sequence defined by each
of these recurrence relations and initial conditions.

b) an =an−1 −an−2,a0 =2,a1 =−1

{2,-1,-3,-2,1,3}

c)an=3an2−1,a0=1

{1,3,27,2187,14348907,617673396283947}

20. Assume that the population of the world in 2010 was 6.9
billion and is growing at the rate of 1.1% a year.

a) Set up a recurrence relation for the population of the world n years after 2010.

(1.011) * P(n-1), P(0) = 6.9

b) Find an explicit formula for the population of the world n years after 2010.

(1.011)^n * 6.9

c) What will the population of the world be in 2030?

About 8.6 billion people

2. Determine whether each of these sets is finite, countably infinite, or uncountable. For those that are countably in- finite, exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive integers and that set.
a) Infinite. f(x) = 10 + x
b) Infinite. f(x) = -2x - 1
c) Finite
d) Uncountable.
e) f(x) = (2, n) if x = 2n -1
        = (3, n) if x = 2n

f) f(x) = 10(n - 1) if x = 2n - 1
        = -10n      if x = 2n

4. Determine whether each of these sets is countable or uncountable. For those that are countably infinite, exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive integers and that set.

a) Countable
b) Countable
c) Countable
d) Uncountable

8. Show that a countably infinite number of guests arriving at Hilbert’s fully occupied Grand Hotel can be given rooms without evicting any current guest.
