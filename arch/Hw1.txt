4. How many different patterns could be stored in a 16-bit register? What is the largest value that could be stored as a (two’s complement) signed integer in such a register? What is the smallest value? How about the largest and smallest values that could be stored as unsigned integers?

5. Convert the following 16-bit binary numbers into hexadecimal and signed decimal numbers (no, you don’t get to use a calculator!):
• 1001110011101110
• 1111111111111111
• 0000000011111111
• 0100100010000100
• 1111111100000000
• 1100101011111110

9. Using a standard ASCII table (check the Internet or appendix E), what 4 hexadecimal bytes would represent the string “Fred”?

10. What ASCII character string would correspond to the hexadecimal number 0x45617379?

12. Why won’t executables created for a Windows Pentium IV run on a PowerPC-based Macintosh (without special software support)?

They don't use the proper instruction sets.

13. What is the most important advantage of a virtual machine over a chip-based architecture?

Portability. You don't have to worry about the final target architecture with a vitrual machine, as code compiled on the virtual machine can be easily ported to every architecture that the virtual machine can be installed on.

14. What is the most important disadvantage?

Performance. By adding another level of abstraction between your code and the hardware, you're adding extra overhead.
