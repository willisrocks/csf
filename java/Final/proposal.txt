Project: Turing Machine Simulator

Description: Build a simple Turing machinei (TM) simulator in Java. The TM will consist of 2 classes: TuringMachine and Tape.

The TuringMachine class will contain the representation of a TM. The TM will need fields for a tape object, head position, alphabet, current state, and the halting state. The TM will read a program from a text file. The TM will contain the following methods: init(), print_tape(), step(), and is_final().

The Tape class will contain the representation of the tape. The tape can be of varying lengths and will get the alphabet from the TM (this will probably be 0 and 1). The tape will use a doubly linked list for it's data structure. Each list in the data structure will contain a previous, data, and next field. I may break the Tape class into 2 different classes with one Tape record that has an array of Cell objects.

Tape Figure (P = previous, C = content, N = next):
START <-- P C N <--> P C N <--> P C N --> END

Program Structure:
Text file where each state is a line of text.
State Structure:
S R W L/R NS
S = state, R = read, W = write, L/R = move left or right, NS = next state
Example:
A01LB     ; state A: if current cell is a 0, replace it with a 1, move the head to the left, and go to state B.

Some example programs I'm thinking of doing:
* Take the compliment of a binary number
* Add two binary numbers
* Increment a number n times
