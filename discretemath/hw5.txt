2. Find the argument form for the following argument and determine whether it is valid. Can we conclude that the conclusion is true if the premises are true? 

If George does not have eight legs, then he is not a spider.
George is a spider.
------------------------
∴ George has eight legs.

P = "George does not have eight legs", q = "George is not a spider"
P -> q
!q  // Modus tollens
------
! P

True

4. What rule of inference is used in each of these arguments?

a) Simplification
b) Disjunctive syllogism
c) Modus ponens
d) Addition
e) Hypothetical syllogism


11. Show that the argument form with premises p1, p2, . . . , pn and conclusion q → r is valid if the argument form with premises p1, p2, . . . , pn, q, and conclusion r is valid.

When (p1,p2,...,pn)->q is a tautology we have a valid argument. If the argument is true, the conclusion is true.


12. Show that the argument form with premises (p ∧ t) → (r ∨ s), q → (u ∧ t), u → p, and ¬s and conclusion q → r is valid by first using Exercise 11 and then using rules of inference from Table 1.

(p ^ t) -> (r V s)  1
q -> (u ^ t)        2
u -> p              3
!s                  4
------
q -> r              5

(p ^ t) -> p 	// simplification from 1
(r V s) and !s -> r // disjunctive syloogism from 1 and 4
(u ^ t) -> u // simplification from 2
q -> u and u ->p -> q -> p // hypthetical syllogism from 2 and 3
(p ^ t) -> t // 1 from simplification
t -> r // 1 from 4
q -> t // 2 from simplification
q -> r // from hypothetical syllogism


22. Which rules of inference are used to establish the conclusion of Lewis Carroll’s argument described in Example 27 of Section 1.4?

∀x(P(x) -> S(x))
!∃(Q(x) ^ R(x))
∀x(!R(x) -> !S(x))
-----------------
∀x(P(x) -> !Q(x)) 

Hypothetical syllogism and resolution.

24. Identify the error or errors in this argument that supposedly shows that if ∀(P (x) ∨ Q(x)) is true then ∀P(x) ∨ ∀Q(x) is true.

1. ∀(P (x) ∨ Q(x)) Premise
2. P(c) ∨ Q(c) Universal instantiation from (1)
3. P(c) Simplification from (2)
4. ∀P(x) Universal generalization from (3)
5. Q(c) Simplification from (2)
6. ∀Q(x) Universal generalization from (5)
7. ∀(P (x) ∨ ∀Q(x)) Conjunction from (4) and (6)



32. Show that the equivalence p ∧¬p ≡ F can be derived using resolution together with the fact that a conditional statement with a false hypothesis is true. [Hint: let q = r = F in resolution.]



33. Use resolution to show that the compound proposition (p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨¬q) ∧ (¬p ∨¬q) is not satisfiable.
