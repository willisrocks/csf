2. Find the argument form for the following argument and determine whether it is valid. Can we conclude that the conclusion is true if the premises are true? 

If George does not have eight legs, then he is not a spider.
George is a spider.
------------------------
∴ George has eight legs.



4. What rule of inference is used in each of these arguments?

a) Kangaroos live in Australia and are marsupials. Therefore, kangaroos are marsupials.

b) It is either hotter than 100 degrees today or the pollution is dangerous. It is less than 100 degrees outside today. Therefore, the pollution is dangerous.

c) Linda is an excellent swimmer. If Linda is an excellent swimmer, then she canwork as a lifeguard. Therefore, Linda can work as a lifeguard.

d) Steve will work at a computer company this summer. Therefore, this summer Steve will work at a computer company or he will be a beach bum.

e) If I work all night on this homework, then I can answer all the exercises. If I answer all the exercises, I will understand the material. Therefore, if I work all night on this homework, then I will understand the material.



11. Show that the argument form with premises p1, p2, . . . , pn and conclusion q → r is valid if the argument form with premises p1, p2, . . . , pn, q, and conclusion r is valid.



12. Show that the argument form with premises (p ∧ t) → (r ∨ s), q → (u ∧ t), u → p, and ¬s and conclusion q → r is valid by first using Exercise 11 and then using rules of inference from Table 1.



22. Which rules of inference are used to establish the conclusion of Lewis Carroll’s argument described in Example 27 of Section 1.4?



24. Identify the error or errors in this argument that supposedly shows that if ∀(P (x) ∨ Q(x)) is true then ∀P(x) ∨ ∀Q(x) is true.

1. ∀(P (x) ∨ Q(x)) Premise
2. P(c) ∨ Q(c) Universal instantiation from (1)
3. P(c) Simplification from (2)
4. ∀P(x) Universal generalization from (3)
5. Q(c) Simplification from (2)
6. ∀Q(x) Universal generalization from (5)
7. ∀(P (x) ∨ ∀Q(x)) Conjunction from (4) and (6)



32. Show that the equivalence p ∧¬p ≡ F can be derived using resolution together with the fact that a conditional statement with a false hypothesis is true. [Hint: let q = r = F in resolution.]



33. Use resolution to show that the compound proposition (p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨¬q) ∧ (¬p ∨¬q) is not satisfiable.
