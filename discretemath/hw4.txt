2. Determine whether f is a function from Z to R if
a) f(n)=±n.
b) f(n)=√n2 +1.
c) f(n)=1/(n2−4).

4. Find the domain and range of these functions. Note that in each case, to find the domain, determine the set of elements assigned values by the function.
a) the function that assigns to each nonnegative integer
its last digit
b) the function that assigns the next largest integer to a
positive integer
c) the function that assigns to a bit string the number of
one bits in the string
d) the function that assigns to a bit string the number of
bits in the string

6. Find the domain and range of these functions.
a) the function that assigns to each pair of positive inte-
gers the first integer of the pair
b) the function that assigns to each positive integer its largest decimal digit
c) the function that assigns to a bit string the number of ones minus the number of zeros in the string
d) the function that assigns to each positive integer the largest integer not exceeding the square root of the integer
e) the function that assigns to a bit string the longest string of ones in the string

8. Find these values
a) ⌊1.1⌋
b) ⌈1.1⌉
c) ⌊−0.1⌋
d) ⌈−0.1⌉
e) ⌈2.99⌉
f ) ⌈−2.99⌉
g)⌊1/2 + ⌈1/2⌉⌉
h) ⌈⌊1/2⌋+⌈1/2⌉+ 1/2⌉

12. Determine whether each of these functions from Z to Z is one-to-one.

a) f(n)=n − 1
b) f(n)=n^2 + 1
c) f(n) = n^3
d) f(n) = ⌈n/2⌉

33. Suppose that g is a function from A to B and f is a function from B to C .
a) Show that if both f and g are one-to-one functions, then f ◦ g is also one-to-one.

40. Let f be a function from the set A to the set B. Let S and T be subsets of A. Show that
b) f(S∩T)⊆f(S)∩f(T).

4. What are the terms a0, a1, a2, and a3 of the sequence {an},
where an equals
a) (−2)^n ? b) 3? c)7+4^n? d)2^n+(−2)^n?

10. Find the first six terms of the sequence defined by each
of these recurrence relations and initial conditions.
b) an =an−1 −an−2,a0 =2,a1 =−1 
c)an=3an2−1,a0=1

20. Assume that the population of the world in 2010 was 6.9
billion and is growing at the rate of 1.1% a year.
a) Set up a recurrence relation for the population of the
world n years after 2010.
b) Find an explicit formula for the population of the
world n years after 2010.
c) What will the population of the world be in 2030?

c) the integers with absolute value less than 1,000,000
d) the real numbers between 0 and 2
e) thesetA×Z+ whereA={2,3}
f) theintegersthataremultiplesof10

4. Determine whether each of these sets is countable or un-
countable. For those that are countably infinite, exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive integers and that set.
a) integers not divisible by 3
b) integers divisible by 5 but not by 7
c) the real numbers with decimal representations consisting of all 1s
d) the real numbers with decimal representations of all 1s or 9s

8. Show that a countably infinite number of guests arriving at Hilbert’s fully occupied Grand Hotel can be given rooms without evicting any current guest.
